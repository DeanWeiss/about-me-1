      <h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Dylan, and I am a veteran and tech professional working out of the Seattle area.
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's of Arts in Law, Economics, and Public Policy with a 4.0 GPA.
      </p>
      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I just recently worked for a new start up as the business development lead. I was able to set up marketing and sales practices for a brand new software company. Prior to that, I was Infantry in the Army with one deployment to Afghanistan. Finally, before that life, I worked as a personal banker and a grocery clerk.
      </p>
      <h2>GOALS</h2>
      <p>
        My primary goal is to obtain employment as a developer, and eventually, start my own company.
