I had a lot of fun with this assignment. I really wanted to account for an invalid input into the prompt. Sam Brindle helped me find a way to get my loops working, so I would not have thought to make a "loopCheck" variable without his suggestion. I know this may not have been the best way to accomplish my goal, but it works. I enjoyed the process.
